# VeriBiota v0.2.1: Deterministic Verification with Proven Guarantees

Today we’re releasing VeriBiota v0.2.1 — our first product-grade release of a verification and provenance system for computational biology pipelines.

This release focuses on one thing: trust earned through alignment, not promises.

VeriBiota is designed to be dropped into existing pipelines:
- Run locally or in CI
- Emit deterministic artifacts
- Fail loudly when invariants are violated
- Leave a durable audit trail (schemas, hashes, provenance records, and optional cryptographic signing)

## What v0.2.1 delivers
- Deterministic verification of structured biology artifacts (profile checks with stable exit codes + machine-readable verdicts)
- Reproducible provenance records suitable for CI gating and audit trails
- Formally proven guarantees (Lean-verified) for selected invariants
- Zero-friction adoption via prebuilt binaries and containerized execution

## Proven in v0.2.1 (Lean theorem-backed)
These profiles have non-placeholder Lean theorem anchors backing the claims:
- Global affine alignment correctness (`global_affine_v1`)
- Edit script application correctness (`edit_script_v1`)
- Edit script normalization (`edit_script_normal_form_v1`): semantic preservation + idempotence
- Snapshot provenance binding (`snapshot_signature_v1`): emitted provenance records are provably bound to:
  - the input hash (`snapshot_hash`)
  - the manifest-registered schema identity and hash (`schema_id`, `schema_hash`)
  - the manifest-registered theorem list (`theorem_ids`)

## Contract-checked today (schema + executable checks; proofs planned)
These profiles are implemented and enforced by schema-aligned decoding + executable checks + fixtures/CI, while proof coverage is still being expanded:
- PairHMM bridge (`pair_hmm_bridge_v1`)
- Prime editing plans (`prime_edit_plan_v1`)
- VCF normalization (`vcf_normalization_v1`)

Additional profiles may exist as schema/manifest entries that are not yet routed in `veribiota check`.

## Important clarification: “snapshot signatures” are not cryptographic signatures
`snapshot_signature_v1` is a provenance binding record, not a key-based signature scheme.
It guarantees integrity and traceability of verification outputs (canonical JSON + hash binding), not nonrepudiation.

For cryptographic authenticity, use the separate Ed25519/JWS signing flow for checks/certificates (verified via JWKS).

## Try it in CI (no Lean install)
Pinned container run (recommended for first-time adopters):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/omnisgenomics/veribiota:v0.2.1
mkdir -p ci_signatures
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work ghcr.io/omnisgenomics/veribiota:v0.2.1 \
  check alignment global_affine_v1 examples/profiles/global_affine_v1/match.json \
  --snapshot-out ci_signatures/global_affine_v1.sig.json --compact
```
